                    <p>
                        Donnie is a bright and eccentric young man who attends high school but despises the vast majority of his schoolmates. <br> <br>
                        Donnie has visions, especially of a monstrous rabbit that only he can see, that encourage him to perform destructive and humiliating games with those around him. <br> <br>
                        Until one day one of his visions lures him out of the house and tells him that the world will end in a month. <br> <br>
                        Donnie doesn't initially believe the prophecy, but moments later a plane crashes right on the roof of his house, almost killing him.<br> <br>
                        That's when he starts to wonder what the truth of his prediction is.

            <h1>Curiosities</h1>
            <img src="./img/slider2" alt= "Donnie Movie">
            <h2>It’s all about the lunar cycle</h2>
            <p>The time "28:06:42:12", indicating how the long the world had left in the movie, was created by adding or subtracting one from each of these numbers: 27:07:43:11, the precise length of one lunar cycle.

                (So, now “The Killing Moon” song choice makes sense!)</p>
            <img src="./img/time" alt="28 days for the world to end">
            <h2>Talking about 28 days… it took that long to shoot the film</h2>
            <p>Which, as it happens, is the exact same length of time that passes during the film's narrative (from the jet engine landing in Donnie's bedroom to the final scene, which ends the same way). But Kelly insists the 28-day theme was pure coincidence.</p>
            <h2>It was Seth Rogen's first ever film appearance</h2>
            <p>Playing the role of high school bully Ricky Danforth, this was Seth Rogen’s first movie appearance -meaning his first ever line on the silver screen was “
                I like your boobs.”<br>
                <br> </p>
                <img src="./img/rogen" alt="">
            <h3>Also.. it was Ashley Tisdale</h3> <br>
            <p>Like Rogen, Donnie Darko was also the first big-screen appearance for Ashley Tisdale. She was so unrecognizable in her role as the dorky teen Kim, that I had to do a double-take. Sharpay wouldn't approve of that look and bad hair day, I'm sure.</p>

            <h2>Donnie’s hometown was originally based on the neighbourhood Richard Kelly grew up in</h2>
            <p>The Director of Donnie Darko Richard Kelly grew up in Midlothian, Virginia, which was the town he referred to in the original script.  This was later changed to Middlesex.</p>
            <h2>Richard Kelly wanted to end the film with U2’s ‘MLK’</h2>
            <p>Working with a small budget, composer Michael Andrews tried (and failed) to get the rights to U2’s ‘MLK’ 
                for the final scene in the movie. Instead, he got his friend Gary Jules to record a cover of the Tears for Fears song
                ‘Mad World’. It was released as a single and reached the top of the UK charts, earning the title of Christmas number 
                one in 2003. </p>

            <h2> Maggie Gyllenhaal wasn’t an immediate choice to play Elizabeth</h2>
            <p>After securing Jake Gyllenhaal for the role, Director Richard Kelly 
                was initially hesitant towards casting his sister Maggie for the role of Elizabeth Darko. 
                But, after being convinced by the scene of her drinking urine in the movie Cecil B. 
                DeMented, he quickly realised he wouldn’t have to work hard at creating a sibling rivalry on screen between the 
                two skilled actors.</p>
            <img src="./img/maggie.gif" alt="Maggie Gyllenhaal">
            <h2>Ferris Bueller's house is a 1 minute walk from Donnie Darko's</h2>
            <p>In the hit 1987 comedy “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off”, his home was filmed at 4160 Country Club Drive, Long Beach, 
                California, just a couple of streets away from where the jet engine falls into Donnie’s bedroom.</p>
            <img src="./img/street" alt="Donnie and Ferris Bueller's neighbourhood">
            <h2>They had to change the poster</h2>
            <p>The original poster art for the movie had an Arabic-style font. This was changed to a more common typeface for 
                the video release because of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p>
            <img src="./img/poster" alt="Donnie Darko's Poster">
            <h2>Now you can read Grandma Death’s “The Philosophy of Time Travel”</h2>
            <p> <em>The Philosophy of Time Travel</em> is a difficult book to read, mainly as it’s imaginary. 
                But much of the text from the book – written by the fictional Grandma Death – is now <a href="http://www.donniedarko.org.uk/philosphy-of-time-travel/" target="_blank">available on the film’s website</a>,
                DVD and has been incorporated into the director’s cut. Happy reading!</p>
            <h2>There was a sequel about Samantha Darko</h2>
            <p>In 2009, Daveigh Chase reprised her role as Donnie's sister, Samantha Darko, in S. Darko—a poorly reviewed sequel that was made without Kelly’s involvement. In 2005, Kelly made it clear that he would never shoot a sequel to Donnie Darko because it would “destroy its integrity.”</p>
